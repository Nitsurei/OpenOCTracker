OpenOCTracker
=============

A drop in solution to host your own OCTranspo bus tracker.

Just need to add your App ID and your API Key to creds.php
(using the sample as a guide)
and you're good to go.  You can apply for your Id and Key at
http://octranspo1.com/developers/register

This is my first real code ever.  Hope it's useful.
